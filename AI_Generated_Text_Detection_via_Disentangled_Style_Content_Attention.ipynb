Captain of King's frigate sends back word that if objectionable person be not at once given up he shall be compelled with much regret to send Ingerfield and his ship to the bottom of the Atlantic. Replies Captain Ingerfield, \\\"That is just what he will have to do before I give up one of my people,\\\" and fights the big frigate--fights it so fiercely that after three hours Captain of King's frigate thinks it will be good to try argument again, and sends therefore a further message, courteously acknowledging Captain Ingerfield's courage and skill, and suggesting that, he having done sufficient to vindicate his honour and renown, it would be politic to now hand over the unimportant cause of contention, and so escape with his treasure.\\n\\n\\\"Tell your Captain,\\\" shouts back this Ingerfield, who has discovered there are sweeter things to fight for than even money, \\\"that the Wild Goose has flown the seas with her belly full of treasure before now, and will, if it be God's pleasure, so do again, but that master and man in her sail together, fight together, and die together.\\\"\\n\\nWhereupon King's frigate pounds away more vigorously than ever, and succeeds eventually in carrying out her threat. Down goes the Wild Goose, her last chase ended--down she goes with a plunge, spit foremost with her colours flying; and down with her goes every man left standing on her decks; and at the bottom of the Atlantic they lie to this day, master and man side by side, keeping guard upon their treasure.\\n\\nWhich incident, and it is well authenticated, goes far to prove that the Ingerfields, hard men and grasping men though they be--men caring more for the getting of money than for the getting of love--loving more the cold grip of gold than the grip of kith or kin, yet bear buried in their hearts the seeds of a nobler manhood, for which, however, the barren soil of their ambition affords scant nourishment.\\n\\nThe John Ingerfield of this story is a man very typical of his race. He has discovered that the oil and tallow refining business, though not a pleasant one, is an exceedingly lucrative one. These are the good days when George the Third is king, and London is rapidly becoming a city of bright night. Tallow and oil and all materials akin thereto are in ever- growing request, and young John Ingerfield builds himself a large refining house and warehouse in the growing suburb of Limehouse, which lies between the teeming river and the quiet fields, gathers many people round about him, puts his strong heart into his work, and prospers.\\n\\nAll the days of his youth he labours and garners, and lays out and garners yet again. In early middle age he finds himself a wealthy man. The chief business of life, the getting of money, is practically done; his enterprise is firmly established, and will continue to grow with ever less need of husbandry. It is time for him to think about the secondary business of life, the getting together of a wife and home, for the Ingerfields have ever been good citizens, worthy heads of families, openhanded hosts, making a brave show among friends and neighbours.\\n\\nJohn Ingerfield, sitting in his stiff, high-backed chair, in his stiffly, but solidly, furnished dining-room, above his counting-house, sipping slowly his one glass of port, takes counsel with himself.\",\n          \"In a world where democracy is increasingly hijacked by the interests of big-business leaders, the tools of political power seem to serve the elite at the expense of the public. Media and news outlets, once seen as the watchdogs of society, are now pressured to turn a blind eye to negative stories about those in power, perpetuating a culture of deception and manipulation. As the youth grow frustrated with their elders for being out of touch with their struggles, they resort to extreme measures like boycotting school or joining gangs, looking for a sense of belonging and purpose in a society that seems to have forsaken them.\\n\\nIn a dystopian twist, the B.R. Act of 2010 sends a public school class to an isolated island to fight to the death as a form of negative reinforcement, promising repeal only if gang violence and truancy rates miraculously decrease. It is within this climate of uncertainty, where food prices, gas prices, and the effects of global warming loom large, that the public's skepticism towards elected officials reaches its peak. Elected figures like Bush and Clinton perpetuate a cycle of political power exchanges that only serve to maintain public complacency, blinding the masses to the illusion of democracy that they so desperately cling to. The author warns of a potential shift towards a fascist state, fueled by public ignorance and apathy towards the erosion of civil liberties.\\n\\nAs the world hurtles towards an uncertain future, where the lines between truth and propaganda blur, one cannot help but wonder: are we truly living in a democracy, or are we merely pawns in a game controlled by unseen puppet masters? The fabric of society is fraying at the seams, with every promise from elected officials ringing hollow and every act of dissent met with harsh reprisals. Are we doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past, or can we break free from this cycle of political power struggles and reclaim our voice in shaping our collective future? The time for complacency is over; the time for action is now. The fate of our democracy hangs in the balance, and it is up to us to decide whether we will allow it to wither away or rise up and fight for a better tomorrow.\",\n          \"It was a large, old-fashioned stone building, with one chimney fallen down, as Mr. Edson had said, and its companion looked likely to follow suit at the first high wind. The windows of the upper story were two-thirds of them destitute of glass, but its place was supplied by shingles, which kept the cold out if they did not let the light in. Scattered about the yard, which was very large, were corn cribs, hay racks, pig troughs, carts, wagons, old plows, horses, mules, cows, hens, chickens, turkeys, geese, negroes, and dogs, the latter of which rushed ferociously at Mr. Wilmot, who was about to beat a retreat from so uninviting quarters, when one of the negroes called out, \\\"Ho, marster, don\\u2019t be feared, \\u2019case I\\u2019ll hold Tiger.\\\" So Wilmot advanced with some misgivings toward the negro and dog.\\n\\nHe asked the negro if his master were at home.\\n\\n\\\"No, sar, marster\\u2019s done gone away, but Miss Nancy, she\\u2019s at home. Jist walk right in thar, whar you see the pile of saddles in the entry.\\\"\\n\\nAccordingly, Mr. Wilmot \\\"walked in where the pile of saddles were,\\\" and knocked at a side door. It was opened by a very handsome young girl, who politely asked the stranger to enter. He did so and found within a mild-looking, middle-aged lady, whose dark eyes and hair showed her at once to be the mother of the young lady who had opened the door for him.\\n\\nMrs. Middleton, for she it was, arose, and offering her hand to the stranger, asked him to be seated in the large stuffed chair which stood before the cheerful blazing fire. In a few moments he had introduced himself, told his business and inquired for Mr. Middleton.\\n\\n\\\"My husband is absent,\\\" said Mrs. Middleton, \\\"but he will be at home tonight and we shall be glad to have you remain with us till tomorrow at least, and as much longer as you like, for I think Mr. Middleton will be glad to assist you in getting a school.\\\"\\n\\nMr. Wilmot accepted the invitation and then looked round the room to see if the interior of the house corresponded with the exterior, It did not, for the room, though large, was very comfortable. The floor was covered with a bright-colored home-made carpet. In one corner stood a bed, the counterpane of which was as white as snow, and the curtains of the windows were of the same hue. In another corner was a small bookcase, well filled with books and on a stand near a window were several house plants.\\n\\nHe concluded that the books and the plants were the property of the young lady, whom Mrs. Middleton introduced to him as her eldest daughter Julia. She was an intelligent-looking girl, and Mr. Wilmot instantly felt interested in her, but when he attempted to converse with her, she stole quietly out of the room, leaving her mother to entertain the visitor.\\n\\nAt last supper was brought in by old Aunt Judy, who courtesied so low to the \\\"young marster,\\\" that she upset the coffee pot, the contents of which fell upon a spaniel, which lay before the fire. The outcries of the dog brought Miss Julia from the kitchen, and this time she was accompanied by her younger sister, Fanny, who together with Julia and Aunt Judy, lamented over the wounded animal.\\n\\n\\\"I didn\\u2019t go to do it, sartin, Miss July,\\\" said Aunt Judy, \\\"Lor\\u2019 knows I didn\\u2019t.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Who said you did, you black thing, you?\\\" said Julia, who in her grief for her favorite, and her anger at Aunt Judy, forgot the stranger, and her bashfulness, too. \\\"You were careless, I know you were,\\\" she continued, \\\"or you never could have tipped the coffee over in this manner.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Never mind, sister,\\\" said Fanny, \\\"never mind; of course, Aunt Judy didn\\u2019t mean to do it, for she likes Dido as well as we do.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

He did not provide an exact number of Australians still in Afghanistan but acknowledged that some visa holders remained in the country.\\n\\n\\\"The situation in Kabul has become extremely volatile, and the risk environment has deteriorated significantly,\\\" Morrison told reporters in Canberra. \\\"It is no longer safe for Australians to travel to the airport or for Australian-contracted flights to operate.\\\"\\n\\nForeign Minister Marise Payne advised Australians and visa holders to avoid the airport due to the risk of further attacks, while Morrison warned that Australians and visa holders unlikely to get seats on remaining flights.\\n\\nDespite Australia's halt, some Western countries have accelerated evacuations, with flights still departing from Kabul. According to Morrison, Australia had evacuated 4,100 citizens and Afghans with visas in the last nine days.\\n\\nMorrison and Payne expressed their condolences to the families of those killed in the attacks and vowed to determine if any Australians or residents were among the casualties.\\n\\n\\\"We offer our deepest sympathies to the families and loved ones of those who have lost their lives or been injured in this senseless act of violence,\\\" Morrison said. \\\"We are working to determine if any Australians were among those killed or injured.\\\"\\n\\nPayne added that the Australian government was \\\"working closely with our international partners and the Afghan authorities to establish a clearer picture of the situation on the ground.\\\"\\n\\nAustralia's military personnel had been evacuated from Kabul hours before the attacks, Morrison said, expressing his gratitude to the military for their efforts in safely bringing Australians home.\\n\\n\\\"I want to thank the Australian Defence Force for their outstanding efforts in evacuating Australians from Kabul,\\\" Morrison said. \\\"Their professionalism, courage, and determination have been critical in bringing Australians home safely.\\\"\",\n          \"As you sit with your journal, a window to your inner world, you may find yourself hesitant to delve into the shadows of your past. It's natural to feel apprehensive, like you're standing at the threshold of a dark cave, unsure of what lies within. Yet, this is where the journey of self-reflection begins \\u2013 by examining yourself through the eyes of others, and perhaps even the eyes of your own inner self.\\n\\nCan you imagine yourself seeing your childhood self, a small and fragile being, navigating the uncharted waters of life? What did you face? What traumas did you carry? Bringing these memories into consciousness can be a daunting task, but it's a crucial step towards healing. Writing about your past experiences allows you to confront the darkness, to bring them out into the open, and to shed light on the wounds that still linger.\\n\\nThink of your memories like a box, sealed tight, locked away from the world. Writing about your past is like opening it up to the light, letting the warmth of awareness penetrate the depths of your being. It's a release, a catharsis that allows you to see the patterns and cycles that have shaped your life. By confronting your past, you can begin to understand how it's influenced your current behavior, how it's shaped your relationships, and how it's impacted your sense of self.\\n\\nHowever, revisiting these memories can be a double-edged sword. Some of these recollections are buried for a reason, hidden from the world because your younger self didn't have the coping skills to deal with them. The mind, much like the body, has its own defense mechanisms to protect against perceived threats. It's a protective veil that guards your inner sanctum, keeping painful memories at bay. But is it time to lift the veil, to confront the shadows that have been lingering in the recesses of your mind?\\n\\nThe path to healing is not always a linear one. Readiness to confront your past is often a reflection of your present circumstances and feelings. Are you feeling stuck in a rut, unsure about your life's direction? Are you plagued by self-doubt, anxious about relationships? These questions may indicate that there are hidden traumas waiting to be unearthed. But what if, in asking these questions, you're also tapped into your divine consciousness, urging you towards personal growth and transformation?\\n\\nCan you hear the whispers of your inner healer, guiding you towards choices that lead to genuine well-being? Listen carefully, for it's a subtle voice that's urging you to confront your past, to break free from the shackles of trauma. It's a gentle nudge, a reminder that you have the power to choose your path, to rewrite your story. Your inner wisdom is the spark that ignites the flame of self-awareness, illuminating the dark corners of your mind.\\n\\nAs you journal, pay attention to the questions that arise. Are you feeling lost, like a ship without anchor or rudder? Or are you feeling joyful, like a bird taking flight? The answers can be revealing, pointing towards the traumas that may be holding you back or the path towards healing and growth. Remember, it's not about dwelling on the pain, but about embracing it as a catalyst for transformation.\\n\\nYour journal is a sacred space, a sanctuary where you can explore the depths of your psyche. It's a place where you can confront your fears, your doubts, and your insecurities. By facing your past, you're not only healing old wounds but also reclaiming your power, your agency, and your sense of self. You're taking back control, breaking free from the shackles of trauma that have held you back for so long.\\n\\nThe process of journaling is not a one-time event but a journey, a path that winds its way through the twists and turns of your life. It's a conversation with yourself, a dialogue that's both introspective and compassionate. Be gentle with yourself as you explore your past, but also be brave, for it's in confronting your traumas that you'll discover your strength, your resilience, and your capacity for growth.\\n\\nAs you write, remember that your memories are not fixed, but fluid, like water that can flow and change shape. By confronting your past, you're not recreating the hurt but rewriting the narrative, creating a new story, one that's infused with hope, healing, and transformation. You're not the same person who was hurt; you're a person who's been hurt, but is now strong enough to face it.\\n\\nThe memories you unearth may not be easy to face, but they're a part of your journey, a reminder of your strength and resilience. By facing your past, you're not only healing yourself but also embracing your humanity, your vulnerabilities, and your capacity for growth. You're not broken; you're becoming whole, a work of art in progress, a masterpiece that's being crafted with each passing day.\\n\\nAs you journal, remember that you're not alone. There are others who've walked this path before you, others who've faced similar struggles and emerged stronger, wiser, and more compassionate. You're part of a community, a collective that's bound together by shared experiences and a deep understanding of the human condition.\\n\\nThe journey of self-reflection is not a solo act but a dance with your inner self. It's a dialogue of contradictions, where darkness and light, pain and healing, coexist in a delicate balance.\",\n          \"She kissed him, and went to meet Elsie.\\n\\n\\\"And you are the dear girl who has been playing and singing for my boy, a wounded stranger here alone among his foes?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, and for all the others, too.\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Cameron seized both of her hands and looked at her tenderly.\\n\\n\\\"You will let me kiss you? I shall always love you.\\\"\\n\\nShe pressed Elsie to her heart. In spite of the girl's reserve, a sob caught her breath at the touch of the warm lips. Her own mother had died when she was a baby, and a shy, hungry heart, long hidden from the world, leaped in tenderness and pain to meet that embrace.\\n\\nElsie walked with her to the door, wondering how the terrible truth of her boy's doom could be told.\\n\\nShe tried to speak, looked into Mrs. Cameron's face, radiant with grateful joy, and the words froze on her lips. She decided to walk a little way with her. But the task became all the harder.\\n\\nAt the corner she stopped abruptly and bade her good-bye:\\n\\n\\\"I must leave you now, Mrs. Cameron. I will call for you in the morning and help you secure the passes to enter the hospital.\\\"\\n\\nThe mother stroked the girl's hand and held it lingeringly.\\n\\n\\\"How good you are,\\\" she said softly. \\\"And you have not told me your name?\\\"\\n\\nElsie hesitated and said:\\n\\n\\\"That's a little secret. They call me Sister Elsie, the Banjo Maid, in the hospitals. My father is a man of distinction. I should be annoyed if my full name were known. I'm Elsie Stoneman. My father is the leader of the House. I live with my aunt.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Thank you,\\\" she whispered, pressing her hand.\\n\\nElsie watched the dark figure disappear in the crowd with a strange tumult of feeling.\\n\\nThe mention of her father had revived the suspicion that he was the mysterious power threatening the policy of the President and planning a reign of terror for the South. Next to the President, he was the most powerful man in Washington, and the unrelenting foe of Mr. Lincoln, although the leader of his party in Congress, which he ruled with a rod of iron. He was a man of fierce and terrible resentments. And yet, in his personal life, to those he knew, he was generous and considerate. \\\"Old Austin Stoneman, the Great Commoner,\\\" he was called, and his name was one to conjure with in the world of deeds. To this fair girl he was the noblest Roman of them all, her ideal of greatness. He was an indulgent father, and while not demonstrative, loved his children with passionate devotion.\\n\\nShe paused and looked up at the huge marble columns that seemed each a sentinel beckoning her to return within to the cot that held a wounded foe. The twilight had deepened, and the soft light of the rising moon had clothed the solemn majesty of the building with shimmering tenderness and beauty.\\n\\n\\\"Why should I be distressed for one, an enemy, among these thousands who have fallen?\\\" she asked herself. Every detail of the scene she had passed through with him and his mother stood out in her soul with startling distinctness--and the horror of his doom cut with the deep sense of personal anguish.\\n\\n\\\"He shall not die,\\\" she said, with sudden resolution. \\\"I'll take his mother to the President. He can't resist her. I'll send for Phil to help me.\\\"\\n\\nShe hurried to the telegraph office and summoned her brother.\\n\\nTHE GREAT HEART\\n\\nThe next morning, when Elsie reached the obscure boarding-house at which Mrs. Cameron stopped, the mother had gone to the market to buy a bunch of roses to place beside her boy's cot.\\n\\nAs Elsie awaited her return, the practical little Yankee maid thought with a pang of the tenderness and folly of such people. She knew this mother had scarcely enough to eat, but to her bread was of small importance, flowers necessary to life. After all, it was very sweet, this foolishness of these Southern people, and it somehow made her homesick.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
